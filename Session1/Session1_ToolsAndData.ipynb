    "In today's session we will be using $\\texttt{uproot}$ and $\\texttt{numpy}$ to access events in ATLAS Open Data data files. Uproot is a python serialisation library that converts files from a ROOT format (a data format ubiqitiously used in High Energy Physics analysis) to regular arrays so we can manipulate it using regular but powerful python libraries. Specifically, we will be \"uprooting\" the data to arrays in $\\texttt{numpy}$, a python library for multidimensional array and matrix manipulation.\n",

They can be distinguished as muon/electron by querying the \"lep_type\" vairable (11 for electrons, 13 for muons). The b-quarks are reconstructed as jets in your dataset (e.g. \"jet_E\" are the jet energies). But remember, quark and gluon interactions in proton collisions also produce so-called initial state and final state radiation, mostly in the form of more jets, and in addition, these datasets have on the order of $\\mathcal{O}(10s)$ of proton-proton interactions in the same event - these are almost always uninteresting low energy quantumchromodynamic processes resulting in additional jets!\n",

    "Now that you know how to retrieve and access the data content, you are ready to analyse it.\n",
    "Histograms are a good way to visualise a dataset and are fundamental to data analysis. They are a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset; A way to visualize the frequency distribution of a set of continuous or discrete data.\n",
    "In particle physics, histograms are often used to visualize the distribution of particle properties such as energy, momentum, or mass. A histogram is created by dividing a variable range into a set of \"bins\" and counting the number of times a particle or event property falls in that bin. Thus, the height of a histogram represents the frequency of events that fall into that bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Histograms can be very useful for understanding features in your data. Here, for example is the distribution of the size of all exo-planets in NASA's Kepler space mission database, showing that smaller planets are more common than massive planets, and that there is an interesting multi-peak feature:\n",

    "\n",
    "A histogram can also be normalised which changes the definition of its content. For example, in the Kepler histograms above each bin measures the number of planets per 100 stars, which is in effect a rate measurement: There are roughly 6 Earth-sized planets for every 100 stars.\n",
    "If one were to sum the counts (all bin heights) and divide all bin counts by the total sum, one would get a rough probablity density distribution: The fraction or probability of planets of a certain radius."

    "### Making a histogram\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make a histogram of some particle variables. A histogram is defined by two arrays: the bin edges and the number of entries in each bin. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Side note: Underflows and overflows** When defining a histogram you need to choose the total range over which the data will be represented as you will be choosing the first bin edge and the last bin edge. Any data that falls outside of this range can be filled in the so-called \"underflow\" and \"overflow\" bins. As the under- and overflow bins theoretically don't have a lower and and upper edge, respectively, they will not accurately represent the continued data distribution. Thus they are not commonly plotted as part of the histogram, however it is sometimes useful to know the fraction of data your histogram is representing relative to the fraction outside its range.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variables for histogramming\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you will retrieve a variable from your input file and make histogram distributions - we'll start by retrieving the number of jets per event (\"jet_n\").\n",
    "\n",
    "After that you can try plotting other variables. Refer to the print out in the second cell of the notebook or see the [ATLAS Open Data Website here](http://opendata.atlas.cern/release/2020/documentation/datasets/dataset13.html) for a list of variables in the dataset. Ask us if you don't understand what a variable means! We will also gradually be learning about most of these variables during this course. "
